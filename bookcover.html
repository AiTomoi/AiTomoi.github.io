                        <p>Project requirements were to listen to three entirely unrelated audiobook stories. They were unrelated by author, by title, and by subject matter. The design of their book covers, however, were to be cohesive and obvious as created
                            in an identifiable style by one singular designer. Contrary to how most books are typically marketed and sold, these three books were not to have any objects or identifiers to their stories used in the development of their
                            covers. In this play on the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover,” I set out to make designs that would invite readership without actually revealing the book’s contents. Conceptually their design relates to the idea, though
                            that idea may not be directly clarified.

                                <p>"Patient Zero" is a story about the initial individual who spreads an epidemic disease. For the design of the book, I used the depiction of a bowling ball as patient zero and then the pins as those who subsequently became
                                    infected.  The impact of the ball hitting the pins signifies the panic caused by a pandemic outbreak.</p>
