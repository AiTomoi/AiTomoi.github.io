                        <p>Project requirements were to listen to three entirely unrelated audiobook stories. They were unrelated by author, by title, and by subject matter. The design of their book covers, however, were to be cohesive and obvious as created
                            in an identifiable style by one singular designer. Contrary to how most books are typically marketed and sold, these three books were not to have any objects or identifiers to their stories used in the development of their
                            covers. In this play on the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover,” I set out to make designs that would invite readership without actually revealing the book’s contents. Conceptually their design relates to the idea, though
                            that idea may not be directly clarified.

I captured this content as a keyhole because I thought it is within ourselves and it is openable and there might be things unseen yet. </p> -->

                            <p>These are pendant tops. The title is "Aloha in Mudra". Mudra is hand gestures having important roles in yogic thought and Indian culture. I created Mudra and Hibiscus. This mudra gesture called "Chin Mudra" envokes the feeling
                                of calmness and lightness. Hibiscus is Koki'o Ke'oke'o which is native in Hawaii. I love doing yoga in Hawaii and I captured this.
